SOCIAL media has become an integral part of human living in recent days. People want to share each and every happening of their life on social media. Nowadays, social media is used for showcasing oneâ€™s pride or esteem by posting photos, text, video clips, etc. The text plays a vital aspect in information shared, where users share their opinions on trending topics, politics, movie reviews, etc. These opinions which people share on social networking sites are generally known as Short Texts (ST) because of its length [1]. ST have gained its importance over traditional blogging because of their simplicity and effectiveness in influencing the crowd. They are even used by search engines in the form of queries. Apart from their popularity, ST has certain challenges like  identification  of  sarcasm,  sentiment,  use  of  slang  words,  etc. Therefore it becomes important to understand short texts and derive meaningful insights from them, which is generally known as Sentiment Analysis (SA)  as stated  in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330014159_Sentiment_Analysis_on_IMDb_Movie_Reviews_Using_Hybrid_Feature_Extraction_Method [accessed Dec 12 2021].
